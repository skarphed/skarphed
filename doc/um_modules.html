                    Modules extend the functionality of your <em>skarphed-core</em>. To be precise: without a module, your <em>skarphed-core</em> won't be able to render a single bit of content. Modules classically are, e.g. a blog, a forum, or a menu.
                </p>
                <h3>Installing Modules</h3>
                <p>
                    <em>Modules</em> is a direct sub-object of <em>skarphed-core</em> in the object-tree and you can open the <em>Modules</em>-objectpage via doubleclicking it. If the <em>skarphed-repo</em> that you chose for this <em>skarphed-core</em> is working properly, you see a list on the right side that contains all its available modules. The list on the left side shows all installed modules (which is empty in fresh <em>skarphed-core</em>-installations). Install or uninstall module simply via drag and drop to the opposite side. Be aware that <em>skarphed-core</em> considers module installations and uninstallations an operation and therefore the operation daemon must be active.
                    When the installationprocess succeded, you should see the module again, but this time at the opposite side. At the same time it is now displayed as a sub-object of <em>Modules</em> in the object-tree.
                </p>
                <h3>Widgets</h3>
                <p>
                    Now you have a widget installed but you want to use it on your page. To achieve this you first have to create a widget. Why are widgets necessary? Simply because, for example you could eventually need. Two distinct blogs on two different thematics on your website. Or you want to have two user-chats on two different topics. In smaller setups it will be very rare to have more than one widget of each module, but widgets offer the possibility to go further. Think of modules as of a factory that produces widgets, and of widgets as cars (things that you can actually touch and work with) that are the products of these factories.
                </p>
                <h3>Creating a widget </h3>
                <p>
                    Right mouseclick on the module that you want to create a widget of and click <em>Create Widget...</em>. You will be asked to enter the name for the new widget. Do so and click <em>OK</em>. Now you have a new widget as sub-element of the module in the object-tree.
                </p>
                <h3>Deleting a widget</h3>
                <p>
                    You can delete a widget by right mouseclicking it and clicking on <em>Delete ... </em> in the context menu.
                </p>
                <h3>Configuring modules and widgets</h3>
                <p>
                    By doubleclicking on modules and widgets in the object-tree you can open their respective object-pages. Please refer to the module's documentations how to use them.
                </p>
